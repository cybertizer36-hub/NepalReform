    "short": "Nepal's foreign relations remain reactive, dependent on India for transit, and vulnerable to external pressure.

    "long": "Nepal's foreign relations remain reactive, dependent on India for transit, and vulnerable to external pressure. Foreign policy shifts with each ruling party, leaving Nepal unpredictable and weak internationally. Nepal is historically caught 'between two boulders'—India and China. The unequal 1950 Indo-Nepal Treaty contains provisions widely criticized as infringing sovereignty. Economic blockades in 1989-90 and 2015-16 demonstrated fragility: the 2015 blockade caused near-zero growth (0.2%) just months after devastating earthquakes. Meanwhile, millions of Nepalis working abroad—3.5 million formal migrants plus uncounted millions in India—represent an under-leveraged strategic asset. In 2023, remittances reached $11 billion (26.6% of GDP), exceeding combined ODA and FDI. Unlike Israel, Ireland, or the Philippines, Nepal lacks legal frameworks for diaspora citizenship, investment protection, or systematic engagement as economic and diplomatic advocates."
