  "problem": {
    "short": "Government employees operate without fear of consequences, leading to complacency, poor service, and misuse of power. Current job security regardless of performance creates a culture where citizens suffer while officials remain comfortable.",
    "long": "Nepal's civil service operates under de facto lifetime employment regardless of performance, competence, or conduct. The Civil Service Act 2049 (1993) and regulations provide strong job protections but weak accountability mechanisms, creating a system where: Poor performers face no consequences—absent officers collect salaries, corrupt officials receive transfers rather than termination, incompetent staff cannot be removed; Citizens have no recourse when facing negligence, delays, corruption, or abuse from government employees; Disciplinary processes exist on paper but rarely result in meaningful consequences due to union protection, political interference, and cumbersome procedures; Merit and effort are not rewarded—hardworking employees see lazy colleagues receive identical treatment, undermining motivation. Result: Government service delivery remains poor despite massive public expenditure on salaries (25%+ of budget). Citizens experience delays, demand for bribes, rudeness, and incompetence as normal. The current system protects government employees at the expense of citizens they are meant to serve."
