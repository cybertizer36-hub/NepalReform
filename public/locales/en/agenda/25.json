    "long": "Rural and marginalized communities in Nepal face severe healthcare access gaps due to underfunded primary care, lack of qualified professionals, poor health infrastructure, and logistical challenges. Urban-rural disparities contribute to preventable deaths, untreated chronic illnesses, and broadening public health inequality. Mountains and remote areas lack basic health facilities; where facilities exist, they often lack medicines, equipment, and qualified staff. Maternal mortality, infant mortality, and communicable diseases remain unacceptably high in rural areas while urban centers concentrate resources. Out-of-pocket healthcare spending pushes families into poverty. Health insurance coverage remains limited with low enrollment among rural and informal sector workers. Mental health services virtually absent. Digital health infrastructure underdeveloped. Result: two-tier healthcare system where urban wealthy access quality care while rural poor suffer preventable illness and death."
