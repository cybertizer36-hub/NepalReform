    "long": "Citizens have no access to information about government spending while financial transactions happen in darkness, enabling massive corruption and waste. The Right to Information Act 2007 requires proactive financial disclosure and the Auditor General Act establishes audit authority, but real-time tracking systems are absent. Government expenditure occurs through opaque processes where budget allocations, procurement contracts, and payment disbursements remain hidden from public scrutiny. Citizens cannot track how tax revenues are spent, which contractors receive government business, or whether funds reach intended beneficiaries. This opacity enables systematic corruption: inflated contracts, ghost beneficiaries, fund diversion, and wasteful spending. Without transparency pressure, officials face no public accountability for financial decisions. Existing financial management systems (LMBIS, SuTRA, provincial systems) operate in silos without public-facing interfaces or real-time disclosure."
