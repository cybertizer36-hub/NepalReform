    "long": "Tourism-related permits and services in Nepal are currently managed across multiple uncoordinated agencies causing procedural inefficiencies, delays, corruption risks, and competitive disadvantage. Current fragmented system: Department of Tourism issues trekking permits and TIMS cards; Department of Immigration manages restricted-area permits and visa extensions; Department of National Parks issues conservation area permits for ACAP, MCAP, Sagarmatha; Nepal Tourism Board coordinates promotion; local governments issue municipal permits like Khumbu Pasang Lhamu permits at NPR 3,000; tourism businesses require separate licenses from multiple offices. Documented problems: Manual permit applications take 3-7 days across multiple offices with tourists physically visiting 3-5 different locations in Kathmandu; cash-based payments without digital tracking enable informal fee collection and corruption; tour operators report spending 20-30% of administrative time on permit coordination; each agency uses different application forms, documentation requirements, processing timelines; remote area tourists cannot obtain permits and must travel to Kathmandu or Pokhara offices. World Economic Forum Travel & Tourism Development Index 2024 ranks Nepal 106th globally, with visa requirements and permit complexity cited as key barriers."
