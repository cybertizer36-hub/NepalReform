    "long": "Ministers and MPs are often chosen through political bargaining rather than expertise, leading to a mismatch that undermines governance, wastes resources, and prevents the Constitution's promise of accountable, effective leadership from being realized. Nepal's Constitution (Article 76) allows the Prime Minister to appoint ministers without requiring relevant qualifications, expertise, or demonstrated competence—only that they be members of federal parliament or, in limited cases, distinguished individuals who become MPs within six months. The result: ministries are treated as political rewards rather than positions of responsibility. Finance ministers without economics backgrounds make fiscal policy. Health ministers with no medical or public health experience manage pandemics. Education ministers unfamiliar with pedagogy reform school systems. This revolving door of unqualified leadership undermines long-term planning, wastes public resources, and prevents competent governance."
