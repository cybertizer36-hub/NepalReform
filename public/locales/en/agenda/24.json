    "long": "Thousands of seized vehicles rot in police stations while students lack practical learning materials for technical education. Government property management creates corruption opportunities and wastes public resources. The Public Property Protection Act provides disposal authority, but lack of transparent systems and clear procedures leads to inefficiency and potential misuse. Seized vehicles—from traffic violations, criminal cases, abandoned imports—accumulate indefinitely in police compounds across Nepal. No clear timelines for disposal, no public registry, no transparent auction processes. Result: valuable assets deteriorate while consuming storage space; genuine owners face obstacles reclaiming property; disposal processes vulnerable to favoritism and corruption; technical education institutions desperately need practical training materials that literally sit unused in government custody. This represents both massive waste and missed opportunity—wasted resources and wasted educational potential."
