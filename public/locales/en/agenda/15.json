    "short": "Nepal loses high-value investors due to fragmented rules, bureaucratic rigidity, and restrictive sectoral limitations. Regulatory bodies lack expertise for effective facilitation while weak safeguards fail to protect national interests from exploitative investment.",
    "long": "Nepal's foreign investment regime suffers from multiple failures: fragmented and contradictory rules across FITTA (Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act), its regulations (FITTR), and sectoral laws creating uncertainty for legitimate investors; bureaucratic rigidity with approval delays averaging 6-12 months even for straightforward projects; restrictive sectoral limitations where negative lists block investment in potentially beneficial sectors without clear rationale; and weak profitability incentives where restricted profit repatriation and dividend transfer policies deter quality investors. Simultaneously, weak safeguards fail to protect national interests: no systematic screening for exploitative investment terms, environmental damage, community displacement, or strategic sector vulnerability. The regulatory architecture—Department of Industry for routine approvals, Investment Board for large projects—lacks specialized expertise in investment screening, sectoral analysis, technology evaluation, or community impact assessment. Result: Nepal attracts minimal quality FDI (less than 1% of GDP annually, among South Asia's lowest) while remaining vulnerable to exploitative resource extraction, land grabbing, and projects with minimal technology transfer or local benefit. The system fails both to attract quality investment AND to protect national interests."

  "legalFoundation": "Foreign Investment and Technology Transfer Act (FITTA) 2019 and its regulations (FITTR) provide legal framework for investment rules, screening, and approval processes. Land Act 2021 prohibits foreign land ownership. Investment Board Act 2011 establishes authority for large project approvals. Constitution Article 51(j) mandates balanced economic development and protection of national interests. Reforms achievable through regulatory amendments and administrative directives; major changes may require FITTA amendment."
