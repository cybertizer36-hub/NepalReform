    "long": "Public financial management suffers from fragmented systems, weak accountability, and outdated processes. LMBIS, Provincial LMBIS, SuTRA, and RMS are not interoperable while budgeting and expenditure decisions are disconnected from implementation. Multiple incompatible financial management systems operate across federal, provincial, and local levels without data sharing or integration. Budgets prepared with unrealistic revenue projections and expenditure estimates disconnected from implementation capacity. National Planning Commission duplicates Ministry of Finance functions creating confusion and delays. Public Procurement Act's risk-averse provisions paralyze bureaucrats fearing prosecution for good-faith decisions, leading to delays and lowest-bidder selection ignoring quality. No citizen access to real-time budget or expenditure data. Auditor General focuses on legal compliance rather than performance evaluation, missing wasteful spending that technically follows rules. Result: low budget execution rates, wasteful projects, procurement delays, and zero public accountability for financial performance."
