    "short": "CIAA remains largely ineffective despite having strong legal powers on paper due to politicized leadership, lack of operational independence, weak institutional capacity, and selective enforcement against low-level officials while high-level political figures escape scrutiny.",
    "long": "Nepal's Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), though constitutionally established under Articles 238 and 239 of the Constitution (2015) and governed by the CIAA Act 2048 (1991) and its Rules 2049, remains largely ineffective despite having strong legal powers on paper. The CIAA holds extensive legal authority under Section 19 (particularly Subsections 6 and 8) of the CIAA Act, which allows it to: Seize documents and property relevant to an investigation, Arrest or take into custody accused persons when necessary, and Directly file and prosecute corruption cases before the Special Court without having to route them through the district courts. However, despite these powers, the CIAA's effectiveness is severely undermined by structural and political weaknesses: Politicised leadership where the Chief Commissioner and other member Commissioners are politically appointed and the Chief Commissioner wields sole discretionary power to approve or block cases; Lack of operational independence where CIAA depends on the Ministry of Finance for its budget; Narrowed jurisdiction where the 2015 Constitution removed its authority to investigate 'improper conduct'; Weak institutional capacity with understaffed investigation and prosecution units lacking advanced forensic and digital tools; Absence of prosecutorial standards enabling selective enforcement; and Incomplete asset recovery framework with weak inter-agency coordination limiting actual recoveries."

            "Enhanced Asset Disclosure and Family Wealth Monitoring: All public officials must declare assets for themselves and immediate/extended family members (spouses, dependent children, parents, siblings); enhanced scrutiny mechanisms cross-reference land registry databases and financial institution records with declared assets; CIAA establishes dedicated units for wealth verification with access to banking, property, and corporate ownership records; targeted transparency with privacy protections applying exclusively to public officials, not general populace",
            "Procedural and Operational Reforms: Authorize court-supervised asset freezing during investigations; establish comprehensive asset recovery mechanisms including full asset recovery, forfeiture, and repatriation procedures; strengthen inter-agency coordination with Department of Money Laundering Investigation, Financial Intelligence Unit, and international counterparts; create dedicated Asset Recovery Unit within CIAA; clarify rules to remove 'policy decision' exemptions for ministers and restore jurisdiction over improper conduct cases",
            "Mandatory Public Prosecutorial Guidelines: CIAA shall publish clear, objective criteria governing case selection, investigation prioritization, and prosecution decisions; guidelines must establish transparent standards for threshold evidence requirements, risk-based prioritization factors, timelines for investigation stages, circumstances warranting case closure, and appeal mechanisms for complainants",
            "Transparent Utilization of Recovered Assets: All funds recovered through corruption prosecutions deposited in dedicated Recovered Assets Fund with public transparency; fund utilization restricted to public infrastructure construction, strengthening anti-corruption capacity, victim compensation, and public development projects; CIAA maintains public, real-time digital dashboard showing total amounts recovered, source cases, allocation decisions, implementation status, and completed projects"
