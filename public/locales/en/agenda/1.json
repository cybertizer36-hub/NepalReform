  "problem": {
    "long": "Nepal's Commission for the Investigation of Abuse of Authority (CIAA), though constitutionally established under Articles 238 and 239 of the Constitution (2015) and governed by the CIAA Act 2048 (1991) and its Rules 2049, remains largely ineffective despite having strong legal powers on paper. Key issues include: Politicised leadership where the Chief Commissioner and other member Commissioners are politically appointed; Lack of operational independence where the CIAA depends on the Ministry of Finance for its budget; Narrowed jurisdiction where the 2015 Constitution removed its authority to investigate 'improper conduct'; and Weak institutional capacity where Investigation and prosecution units are understaffed, siloed, and lack advanced forensic and digital tools."
