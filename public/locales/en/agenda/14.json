    "short": "Security personnel are chosen for loyalty rather than capability, undermining professionalism. Lack of routine health and integrity checks results in officers with substance abuse, untreated stress disorders, or compromised fitness remaining in positions that risk public safety.",
    "long": "Nepal's security services—Nepal Police, Armed Police Force (APF), and other law enforcement agencies—suffer from systematic appointment and promotion practices prioritizing political loyalty over professional capability. This undermines operational effectiveness, public trust, and institutional professionalism. Political patronage drives appointments to senior positions, particularly Inspector General of Police (IGP) and top leadership roles. Officers are selected based on party affiliation, personal connections, or regional quotas rather than merit, competence, or track record of effective service delivery. Additionally, routine health and integrity checks are absent or poorly enforced. Officers with substance abuse issues, untreated mental health conditions (PTSD, stress disorders from conflict-era service), or compromised physical fitness remain in positions requiring critical decision-making and public interaction. This poses risks to both public safety and officer wellbeing. Performance evaluations lack objectivity and transparency, with promotions often determined by seniority or political connections rather than demonstrated competence, ethical conduct, or results-based assessment. There is no systematic tracking of officers' health, fitness, or integrity over their careers."
