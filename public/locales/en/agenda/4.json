    "long": "Politicians become millionaires on government salaries. Where does the money come from? Politicians accumulate substantial wealth on modest government salaries without transparency about sources, enabling corruption and undermining public trust. Current asset declaration systems are confidential rather than public, preventing citizen oversight. Nepal's Prevention of Corruption Act 2002 (Section 3) requires public officials to file asset declarations with CIAA, but these remain confidential under CIAA Act Section 28, accessible only during investigations. Election Commission requires candidate declarations under Representation of People Act 2017 (Section 13), yet details are buried in PDF files, not searchable or analyzable. The result: Politicians' wealth grows exponentially with no public accountability, while citizens cannot verify if officials' lifestyles match their declared incomes."
