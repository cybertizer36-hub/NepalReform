    "long": "Nepal's senior civil service positions—Chief District Officers (CDOs), Secretaries, Director Generals, heads of government agencies and corporations—are systematically filled through political appointments prioritizing party loyalty over professional competence. Despite Civil Service Act 2049 (1993) requiring merit-based recruitment and Constitution Article 51 mandating competent governance, current practice involves: Political parties distributing senior positions as rewards for loyalty, electoral support, or party service rather than professional qualification; Frequent arbitrary transfers and removals based on political considerations rather than performance; Appointees lacking relevant expertise, educational qualifications, or administrative experience for their roles; Policy discontinuity as each government change brings wholesale personnel replacements serving new ruling coalition. Result: Incompetent administration where policies serve political party interests rather than citizens; development programs designed for electoral benefit rather than effectiveness; institutional knowledge lost through constant turnover; professional civil servants demoralized as merit means nothing compared to political connections. The system transforms public administration into extension of partisan politics, undermining governance quality and citizen trust."

            "Lateral Entry from Private/Professional Sector: Allow qualified professionals outside civil service to compete for senior positions within 6-12 months of opening; brings expertise from private sector, academia, NGOs, international organizations; requires competitive examination plus relevant professional experience; maximum 20-30% of senior positions through lateral entry preventing institutional disruption",
            "Independent Selection Panels: Senior position interviews conducted by panels with retired senior civil servants, technical subject-matter experts, Public Service Commission representatives, and civil society observers; zero active politicians or political appointees on panels; panels evaluate leadership, integrity, strategic thinking, and fit for specific role; provide binding recommendations to appointing authority; government must publicly justify any deviation from panel recommendations"
