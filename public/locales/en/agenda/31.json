    "long": "Nepal's tourism statistics are fragmented across multiple agencies with inconsistent methodologies, significant publication delays, lack of granular data, and no centralized public access platform. Current fragmented system spreads tourism data across Nepal Tourism Board (NTB) publishes annual Nepal Tourism Statistics but data arrives 8-12 months late, aggregated at national level without district/route breakdowns, lacks demographic details beyond nationality; Department of Immigration tracks visa issuance and border crossings but data not publicly accessible, no integration with NTB statistics, inconsistent categorization of tourist types; Department of Tourism manages trekking permits (TIMS cards) but manual record-keeping in field offices, delayed aggregation, no real-time visibility; Department of National Parks issues conservation area permits (ACAP, Sagarmatha NP) with separate databases not linked to tourism statistics; Nepal Rastra Bank tracks foreign exchange earnings but tourism revenue estimates based on surveys, not transaction data, published annually with 12-18 month lag; Tribhuvan International Airport Corporation records passenger arrivals but limited demographic data collection, not disaggregated by purpose of visit. Documented problems include inconsistent tourist counts where NTB reports 1.2M tourists (2019) while Immigration reports different figures due to varying definitions; lack of real-time data preventing rapid response to trends, crises, or opportunities; no subnational granularity making provincial/district planning impossible; researchers and businesses cannot access raw data for analysis; international incomparability as Nepal's statistics don't meet UNWTO standards for tourism satellite accounts. World Bank Doing Business indicators and UNWTO Tourism Statistics frameworks both highlight Nepal's data transparency gaps as barriers to investment and planning."
