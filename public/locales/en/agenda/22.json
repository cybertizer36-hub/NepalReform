    "long": "Citizens forced to choose between inadequate candidates have no way to reject all options, reducing democratic legitimacy and voter satisfaction. Article 17 protects freedom of expression including the right to reject, and the Supreme Court has mandated Nepal Government and Election Commission to guarantee None of the Above in ballot papers, but implementation is pending. Voters facing choices between incompetent, corrupt, or otherwise unsuitable candidates must either vote for unsatisfactory option or not vote at all. This forces participation in legitimizing inadequate representation or abstention signaling apathy rather than dissatisfaction. Result: elected representatives often lack genuine popular support; parties nominate poor candidates knowing voters have no rejection mechanism; democratic legitimacy weakened when officials claim mandate despite voter dissatisfaction. NOTA would provide meaningful democratic voice allowing citizens to formally reject all candidates, pressuring parties to improve candidate quality."
