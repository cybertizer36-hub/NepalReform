    "long": "Judges appointed through political connections compromise court independence while lack of transparency in judicial conduct and appointments undermines rule of law and public trust. Article 126 guarantees judicial independence and Articles 128-138 establish Supreme Court authority, but implementation mechanisms are weak. Nepal's Constitution provides for a Judicial Council (Article 153) to recommend judicial appointments, but the Council is politically influenced: chaired by Chief Justice, includes Minister for Law, and two senior Supreme Court justices appointed by the same political process. Parliamentary Hearing Committee (Article 292) reviews judicial nominations but operates based on political party quotas rather than merit evaluation. Result: judicial appointments are negotiated between political parties, with candidates' party affiliations and political connections often more important than legal competence or integrity. Public has no visibility into appointment process, judicial performance, or asset declarations. Courts lack operational independence with budget controlled by Ministry of Law, limiting their ability to operate free from executive pressure."
