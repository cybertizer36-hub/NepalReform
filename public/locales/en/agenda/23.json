    "long": "Concentration of power in a single leader for extended periods undermines democratic renewal and creates opportunities for institutional capture and corruption. Article 76 governs Prime Minister appointment but lacks term limits, allowing indefinite tenure that can lead to authoritarian tendencies and prevent healthy democratic rotation of leadership. Extended tenure enables: patronage networks that entrench power; institutional capture serving individual rather than public interest; stifling of emerging leadership and fresh perspectives; personalization of governance around individual rather than institutions; corruption opportunities through long-term control of appointments and resources. While parliamentary system provides checks through vote of confidence, lack of constitutional term limits means technically unlimited tenure for dominant leaders. Healthy democracies require regular leadership renewal ensuring fresh ideas, generational transitions, and preventing excessive power concentration."
