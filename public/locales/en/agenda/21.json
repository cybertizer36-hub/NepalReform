    "long": "Government decisions made behind closed doors without public input or oversight while citizens have no access to information about what their representatives discuss or decide. Article 27 guarantees Right to Information and the Constitution mandates transparency, but implementation lacks live broadcasting, public participation mechanisms, and timely information access. Cabinet meetings, Parliamentary sessions, local government councils, and policy deliberations occur without public visibility. Citizens cannot observe how decisions affecting their lives are made, who supports or opposes specific policies, or what rationale justifies government actions. This opacity enables: backroom deals benefiting special interests; policy decisions made without public input; lack of accountability for poor decisions; and erosion of democratic legitimacy. Information requests under RTI Act face delays, arbitrary denials, and bureaucratic obstacles. Even when information is eventually provided, citizens lack proactive disclosure of routine government operations, making oversight reactive rather than systematic."
