  "timeline": "3 years",
  "problem": {
    "short": "Party leaders appoint PR representatives without voter input, weakening democratic accountability. Constitutional Article 84 mandates 110 PR seats ensuring inclusion for marginalized communities, but selection processes lack transparency and democratic legitimacy.",
    "long": "Nepal's mixed electoral system under Article 84 allocates 110 of 275 House seats through Proportional Representation (PR) to ensure inclusion of women, Dalits, indigenous communities, Madhesis, Tharus, Muslims, and backward regions. However, party leaders appoint PR candidates without meaningful voter input, creating representatives accountable to party bosses rather than constituents or communities they represent. Selection criteria remain opaque with no public disclosure of qualifications, party member consultation, or competitive evaluation. Result: PR representatives often lack competence, community connection, or democratic legitimacy despite serving vital inclusion function. System weakens overall democratic accountability while undermining the very inclusion goal it aims to achieve—marginalized communities deserve both representation AND quality representatives selected through transparent, participatory processes rather than top-down patronage appointments."
