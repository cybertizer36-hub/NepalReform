    "long": "Nepal's Ministry of Culture, Tourism and Civil Aviation (MoCTCA) operates under the administrative cadre system where leadership and staff lack required technical expertise in tourism, hospitality, data science, or sustainability. Unlike Health, Forestry, or Education ministries with specialist staff, MoCTCA employs generalist administrators frequently transferred across ministries (average tenure 2-3 years), undermining institutional memory and sectoral knowledge. Core deficiencies include: No technical expertise required with zero data scientists, GIS specialists, or sustainable tourism experts on permanent staff; cannot conduct tourism forecasting, spatial planning, or evidence-based policymaking; weak digital marketing capability despite 82% of tourism decisions beginning online; reactive policymaking unable to implement global best practices or respond to trends; no technical standards for sustainable tourism infrastructure. Tourism contributes 6.7% of Nepal's GDP (2019) and employs 1+ million people, yet the ministry lacks capacity to maximize this potential or manage sustainability challenges."
