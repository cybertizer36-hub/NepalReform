    "long": "Although Nepal has made considerable progress in digitizing major government functions—such as budgetary systems, revenue collection, passports, driving licenses, immigration, and national ID—these systems remain fragmented and lack interoperability. Citizens still face bureaucratic delays, multiple office visits, and corruption opportunities because digital systems don't talk to each other. Birth certificates issued digitally can't be automatically used for school enrollment. Land ownership records aren't linked to tax systems. Passport applications require physical submission of citizenship certificates already in government databases. Each ministry operates isolated systems, forcing citizens to submit the same documents repeatedly and creating opportunities for officials to demand bribes for faster processing."
