Key issues include: Politicised leadership where the Chief Commissioner and other member Commissioners are politically appointed; Lack of operational independence where the CIAA depends on the Ministry of Finance for its budget; Narrowed jurisdiction where the 2015 Constitution removed its authority to investigate 'improper conduct'; and Weak institutional capacity where Investigation and prosecution units are understaffed, siloed, and lack advanced forensic and digital tools."
